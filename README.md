## Project Overview

A brief summary of what this project does.  
For example:  
This project analyses PAN (Permanent Account Number) data for validation, pattern recognition and error detection. The goal is to explore the dataset, validate the PAN numbers, find anomalies, visualise insights and produce clean or processed outputs.

---

## Motivation

Why this project is important / useful.  
- Helps verify whether given PAN numbers are valid or invalid.  
- Can be used by businesses or government agencies for data cleaning.  
- Useful demonstration of data validation, data cleaning & EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).

## Dataset Description

Describe the datasets used. Include things like:

| File | Description | Format | Key Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PAN Number Validation Dataset.csv` | Original dataset of PAN numbers and associated attributes | .csv | number of rows, columns, missing values etc. |
| `PAN Number Validation Dataset.xlsx` | Excel version of same dataset | .xlsx | maybe includes metadata or separate sheets? |
| `OUTPUT.sql` | SQL dump / output from processed data | .sql | what the output contains |
| `output.ipynb` | Jupyter Notebook with analysis and visualisations | .ipynb | which tasks are done: cleaning, validation, summarization, etc. |

Also note number of records, types of attributes (string, numeric), missingness etc.

## Problem Statement

What exactly are you trying to answer or solve. For example:  
- How many PAN numbers in the dataset are valid vs invalid?  
- What kinds of formatting errors or patterns of invalidity exist?  
- Statistical summaries of the data.  
- Visualising common error types.  
- Proposing methods for cleaning / validating PAN numbers automatically.

## Technologies Used

List the main tools, languages, libraries used. Examples:  

- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- SQL  
- Any other libraries (e.g. regex for validation)
